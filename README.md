# Causal Inference - Effect of Perfluoroalkyl Substances on Renal Function
## Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a sum-of-trees regression model that shows great performance for causal inference tasks.

## Simulation Study
To compare the peformance of BART to other methods when the treatment is continuous, a simulation study is performed. BART is compared to Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW), Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and Generalized Propensity Scores (GPS) methods. 

Three simulation scenarios are created, each with three levels of model misspecification: no misspecification, moderate misspecification, strong misspecification.
