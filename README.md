# Causal Inference - Effect of Perfluoroalkyl Substances on Renal Function
## Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a sum-of-trees regression model that shows great performance for causal inference tasks.

## Simulation Study
To compare the peformance of BART to other methods when the treatment is continuous, a simulation study is performed. BART is compared to GAM, IPTW, TMLE, and GPS.
